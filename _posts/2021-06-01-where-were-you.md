## First of all... apologies

At the beginning of this post I should ask you for forgiveness. It has been a loooong time since I wrote my last post here. I posted last year at blogersii.pl about [OAuth2.0 and on Behalf flow in Azure Active Directory and .NET Core](https://sii.pl/blog/oauth-2-0-on-behalf-flow-in-azure-active-directory-and-net-core/).

For the last year I have been focused on improving my skills, graduating from university and learning to gain certifications in [Azure Development](https://www.credly.com/badges/f39039dc-8f35-486e-8d59-5d67dee91f3e/). Next in queue is Azure Solutions Architect that I wish to get in coming months. 

## What will be the next steps?

I am devoted to write a lot more posts by the end of the year. I want to share as much as I can with you. In coming days I am going to describe possible messaging solutions in Azure, to show how to use them and what are the best usecases for each of them. I believe this blog post will show up by the end of the next week! 

Stay tuned!
