I recently had the privilege of leading a workshop on Azure Durable Functions in Krakow, hosted by Gravity9. This event provided a fantastic platform for me to dive deep into the intricacies of Azure Durable Functions and share practical insights from my experiences working with this technology. It was an enriching session filled with engaging discussions, where we explored real-world use cases, best practices, and some of the common challenges developers face when implementing Durable Functions.

Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to everyone who attended and contributed to making the workshop so interactive and insightful. For those who couldnâ€™t join us, the session was recorded, and youâ€™re welcome to watch the ðŸŽ¥ [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjtixzEM4oA) at your convenience. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any follow-up questions or need further clarification on any of the topics we covered.

Looking forward to continuing these discussions at the next meetup! Iâ€™m excited to see how everyone implements what theyâ€™ve learned and to share more advanced concepts in the future.
