In cooperation with [Gravity9](https://gravity9solutions.com) I am creating web applicatin for American Homes 4 Rent. The goal of the tool is to make house leasing easy and contactless. We are working on great experience for applicant but also for current resident. It is simple to get into property without an agent, using "Let Yourself In" flow that provides you with access code to the doors of a house you dream of. From resident perspective you can manage your service request in case your pipe is broken or anything else goes wrong. Everything in one place.
