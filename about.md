### Contact me

You can put in touch with me via this email: **pawel.pindel@netsharpdev.com**

### Who am I?

My name is Paweł Pindel, I am Software Engineer from Poland, currently working for [Talmundo](https://talmundo.com). As a developer I have over 4 years of professional experience. I am Microsoft Technologies enthusiast but also open for other tech stacks. Trying to pick language adequate to the problem - not to solve all problems with one language or framework.

My motto is:
>Try to learn something about everything and everything about something. <cite>― Thomas Henry Huxley</cite>

Besides development, I am amateur chef and also really enjoy travelling and hiking around the world but especially in love with polish countryside and nature. In my free time I play the guitar.

### Why do I write?

I am writing this blog to share my knowledge about development but also to learn. It is a great opportunity to improve skill when I have to prepare professional text about a chosen topic. I also want to learn from you! So please leave a comment if you have something to say on what I wrote.

*Thank You for reading!*
