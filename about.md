### Who I am?

My name is PaweÅ‚ Pindel, I am Software Engineer from Poland, currently working for [Talmundo](https://talmundo.com). As a developer I have over 4 years of professional experience.

My motto is:
>Try to learn something about everything and everything about something. <cite>Thomas Henry Huxley</cite>

### Why I write?

I am writing this blog to share my knowledge about development but also to learn. It is a great opportunity to improve skill when I have to prepare professional text about a chosen topic. I also want to learn from you! So please leave a comment if you have something to say on what I wrote.

*Thank You for reading!*
